Here I am going to deal real world issues with logistic regression using the knowledge and data I have learned in machine learning


#   Logistic Regression Implementation

    This repository contains a Python implementation of logistic regression, covering both standard and regularized versions. The code demonstrates the application of logistic regression to classification problems using different datasets.

    ##   Topics Covered

    * **Sigmoid Function:** Implementation of the sigmoid function, a core component of logistic regression.
    * **Cost Function:** Implementation of the cost function for logistic regression, including both the standard and regularized versions.
    * **Gradient Descent:** Implementation of gradient descent to learn the parameters of a logistic regression model.
    * **Gradient Calculation:** Calculation of the gradient of the cost function for both standard and regularized logistic regression.
    * **Decision Boundary Plotting:** Techniques for visualizing the decision boundary learned by a logistic regression model.
    * **Model Evaluation:** Implementation of a prediction function and evaluation of model accuracy.
    * **Regularization:** Implementation of regularized logistic regression to address overfitting.
    * **Feature Mapping:** Use of feature mapping to create polynomial features and improve model fit for non-linear datasets.

    ##   Datasets

    The implementation is applied to the following datasets:

    * Dataset for predicting student admission to a university.
    * Dataset for microchip quality assurance.

    ##   Packages Used

    * numpy
    * matplotlib

    ##   How to Use

    This repository provides a practical implementation of logistic regression concepts. You can use the code to:

    * Understand the underlying mathematics of logistic regression.
    * Learn how to implement logistic regression from scratch.
    * Apply logistic regression to solve classification problems.
    * Experiment with regularization techniques.
